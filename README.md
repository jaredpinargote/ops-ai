# AI and OPS
Some in the Objective Personality System (OPS) community have been fascinated by the potential to use AI to type themselves and others.

I have 5 years of experience in experimenting with new technology as a software engineer, focused primarily on AR/VR. Ever since the release of ChatGPT, I shifted my focus and career to AI.

For the past 9 months I have been upskilling in machine learning (ML) engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and other general data science skills such as statistics and presentation of analysis to a general, non-tech audience.

I will share my thoughts and explorations here in this repo. I hope this serves as an inspiration to your own personal exploration and maybe even business ventures in coaching. I do not have the bandwidth nor motivation to try and profit from this research. 

If you would like to enhance your OPS coaching with AI based on the information/research here, feel free to ask me questions at jaredpnrgt@yahoo.com. I am always happy to take 30 mins to get to know you and help out as much as I can :)

# The Basics of AI

You may have heard "AI" become a more popular term now with the rise of ChatGPT. But what exactly *is* ChatGPT? ChatGPT is a type of language model (a set of numbers and connections that encode language) which can generate human-like text responses. A language model (or large language model, LLM) is just one form of AI. It's an amazing tool that can talk with you, answer questions, and even create content.

AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to digital systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI involves training machines to process and analyze tons of data, identify patterns, and make predictions or take actions based on that data. In processing language (like video transcripts), AI is useful because it can quickly analyze large amounts of text data, identify patterns, and generate responses that are relevant and logical.

This language processing ability can help us identify patterns in human behavior. By analyzing vast amounts of text data (like an hour long video), AI can identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent to you. For example, AI can identify communication style, what people care about, and what motivates them.

Hopefully you can start to see how AI can be a powerful tool in detecting patterns that point to traits that result in recurring life problems, or *coins* as is referred to OPS.
