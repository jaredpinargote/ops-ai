# AI and OPS
Some in the Objective Personality System (OPS) community have been fascinated by the potential to use AI to type themselves and others.

I have 5 years of experience in experimenting with new technology as a software engineer, focused primarily on AR/VR. Ever since the release of ChatGPT, I shifted my focus and career to AI.

For the past 9 months I have been upskilling in machine learning (ML) engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and other general data science skills such as statistics and presentation of analysis to a general, non-tech audience.

I will share my thoughts and explorations here in this repo. I hope this serves as an inspiration to your own personal exploration and maybe even business ventures in coaching. I do not have the bandwidth nor motivation to try and profit from this research. 

If you would like to enhance your OPS coaching with AI based on the information/research here, feel free to ask me questions at jaredpnrgt@yahoo.com. I am always happy to take 30 mins to get to know you and help out as much as I can :)
